Project part of the Odin Project Curriculum
[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg)](https://github.com/Viktordotcom/Etch-a-Sketch.git)

Things I learned from this project:
1. How to Create DOM elements (Nodes), manipulate their properties and attributes.
2. How to use 'Mouseover' event listener on a Html Collection item.
3. How to create a resizable Grid using the CSS property tools.

Things I struggled with:
1. Using the right CSS propery to make the grid resizable on user Input values.
2. Making the container pixel size remain same, while changing the content numbers inside it.
2. Remove all child Nodes from a certain Html Collection.
3. CSS Media query numbers

Time spent on the project: ~ 24 hours
